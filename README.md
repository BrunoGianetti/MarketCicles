Brazilian Market Cicles: a behavioral study of time.

## How it work
I'm in a brazilian market stocks about one year and I have much ideias to apply Data Science on my trades. This is a example which I spend my time to improve conclusions about 26 years ago about behavioral time and prices.

In this image below, you can get the ideia about april, november and december are the most valorous months in a year. Remember that the database is 26 years of data.
